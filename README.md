# Finances
This is a Python script that I built using Pandas to track my finances better than a spreadsheet could. Originally it was just a command line program, but now the back-end has been removed from the command line interface so additional interfaces can easily be added on top of the program. The first new interface I built was a simple web interface that allows all common actions to be executed.
